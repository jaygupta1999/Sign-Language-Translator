# Sign-Language-Translator
There is a need of a method or an application that can recognize sign language gestures so that the communication is possible even if someone does not understand sign language. With this work, we intend to take a basic step in bridging this communication gap using Sign Language Recognition.
Communication gap is one of the major issues that lead to conflicts, misunderstanding or misjudgment; this mostly happens due to lack of communication, but what if the person cannot speak? Now , this made us to think about creating an application that can recognize Sign-language gestures, so communication is possible even if someone does not understand sign language.
