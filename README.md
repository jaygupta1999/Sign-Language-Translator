# Sign-Language-Translator
There is a need of a method or an application that can recognize sign language gestures so that the communication is possible even if someone does not understand sign language. With this work, we intend to take a basic step in bridging this communication gap using Sign Language Recognition.
Communication gap is one of the major issues that lead to conflicts, misunderstanding or misjudgment; this mostly happens due to lack of communication, but what if the person cannot speak? Now , this made us to think about creating an application that can recognize Sign-language gestures, so communication is possible even if someone does not understand sign language. 

Sign Languages are a set of languages that use predefined actions and movements to convey a message. These languages are primarily developed to aid deaf and other verbally challenged people. They use a simultaneous and precise combination of movement of hands, orientation of hands, hand shapes etc. Different regions have different sign languages like American Sign Language, Indian Sign Language etc.

Using TensorFlow to translate Sign Language in real-time. Final Release

The Sign Language Translator is my hackathon project for Hacksrm and the âš¡#PoweredByTF 2.0 Challenge!. Its purpose is to allow users to communicate more effectively with their computers and other people. To be specific, using this program, you can sign multiple words with one gesture and copy the translated text with the click of a button. Additionally, users can video call each other and talk using gestures that get converted into Computer Speech.
